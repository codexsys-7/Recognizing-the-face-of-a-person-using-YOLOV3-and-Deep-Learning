YOLOV3 is a state-of-the-art object recognition algorithm which can be trained on any kind of data and it will detect that particular object precisely wherever it might be. With the combination of yolo and deep learning module in OpenCV we have achieved a more precise face detection model. When an image is passed to the model, this will try to find the images and draws a kind of bounding box around them, which might be easier for users to understand, along with the bounding boxes, this will also display how confident the model is in predicting the persons face.
